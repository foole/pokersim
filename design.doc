Rough notes for the python files.

hand.py:

This will contain all the information about a poker hand and community
cards. It will also determine the best possible hand for the hand
object. (multiple hand object comparisons will probably be handled
outside this class)

There will be two classes: Hand and Community, each of which should be
self explanatory.


deck.py:

This will contain a collection of cards (52, a standard deck) and will
have methods to pull off (or deal) cards to individual hands. It will
also deal out community cards (as well as burn cards).


stats.py: 

This is a stats collector. Here are the stats that we should collect:

- hand
- number of total hands
- rank out of total hands (1 to n)
- community cards (order should be preserved)


In addition, the stats collector should read a file at startup (or open
for writing if it doesn't exist) and load previously run results. It
should have an option for starting over or writing to a new file.

god.py:

Will probably mostly be used for debugging and initial testing. It will
be able to see everything that the dealer sees, each player sees, and
have an all seeing eye into the deck.
