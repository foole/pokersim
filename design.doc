Rough notes for the python files.

hand.py:

This will contain all the information about a poker hand. A poker hand
can be anywhere from 2-7 cards depending on the variant.


table.py:

A table is a collection of players, a dealer, and a deck of cards.


community.py:

This will contain all the information about the community cards. For
starters, we will assume that it ranges from 0 - 5, but there are almost
certainly variants that are outside that range.


dealer.py:

Will distribute cards, fill the community (if any), and determine the
best hand of the available hands.


rank_hand.py:

It will determine the best possible hand for the hand object. (multiple
hand object comparisons will probably be handled outside this class)


card.py:

This will describe an individual card and will have methds to compare
individual cards (as well as methods to stringify the card).


deck.py:

This will contain a collection of cards (52, a standard deck) and will
have methods to pull off (or deal) cards to individual hands. It will
also deal out community cards (as well as burn cards).



stats.py:

This is a stats collector. Here are the stats that we should collect:

- hand
- number of total hands
- rank out of total hands (1 to n)
- community cards (order should be preserved)


In addition, the stats collector should read a file at startup (or open
for writing if it doesn't exist) and load previously run results. It
should have an option for starting over or writing to a new file.
